        <h3 class="logi_title">COVID-19 Quarantine Management System</h3>
        <p>Through this system, the COVID-19 quarantined people can be monitored. They can update their health status
            daily to the Police and also they can send their requests for their daily needs. All the quarantined people
            who are having a smartphone can install this StayHomeLK app. Through the app, they will be connected to the
            Central Quarantined People Management System. The Police will use the central system to check the health
            status and other daily requirements of the quarantined people that use the mobile app, through the Central
            system.

            App Store.</p>

            his or her mobile phone number.
